# Glossary

This glossary is a comprehensive list of Zowe terminology. It includes technical terms that are specific to Zowe.

## Main Components

* **Zowe Component**
 
  Zowe is a collection of both client and server code. You can install just some of Zowe, or all of it, depending on your needs. Zowe splits the major sections of the code into "Components" which each serve an important purpose. Server Components are packaged in a standardized way to include all services and plugins in one deliverable. Extensions to Zowe can also be delivered as third party Server Components. See: https://docs.zowe.org/stable/extend/packaging-zos-extensions/#zowe-component-manifest

* **Zowe server components**

  Also known as "Zowe z/OS components" or "Zowe server-side components". Include all the Zowe components that are installed on the z/OS server. 

* **Zowe client components**
 
  Also known as "Zowe client-side components". Include all the Zowe components that are installed on the users PC. 

* **API Mediation Layer (API ML)**

  provides a single point of access for mainframe service REST APIs.

* **Zowe Application Framework**

  The Zowe Application Framework modernizes and simplifies working on the mainframe. With the Zowe Application Framework, you can create applications to suit your specific needs. It is a web user interface (UI) that provides a virtual desktop containing a number of apps allowing access to z/OS function. 

* **Zowe CLI**

* **Zowe Explorer** 

* **Zowe Client SDKs** 

* **Zowe Embedded Browser for RMF/SMF and APIs (ZEBRA)** 

  Provides re-usable and industry compliant JSON formatted RMF/SMF data records, so that many other ISV SW and users can exploit them using open-source SW for many ways. For more information, see the ZEBRA documentation or visit the ZEBRA test/trial site. 
       
* **Zowe Workflow WiZard**

* **Zowe Launcher**

  A server-side program necessary for high availability / fault tolerance (HA/FT). It starts the Zowe server components and monitors their processes so that if a component fails to start or crashes, the launcher will restart it. The restarting of a component has limits to prevent loops in case of a component that has uncorrectable problems.

## Architecture

* **Imperative** 

  It's the framework powering Zowe CLI and Zowe Explorer.

* **Explorer** 

  It's the plugin suite for popular client-side editors such as VSCode.

* **Web Explorer**

  It's a suite of websites which is part of the Zowe server installation. It includes the JES, MVS, USS, and IP Explorers. It's not related to the "Explorer" which can be confusing.

* **ZLUX**  

  This is a codename for the Zowe Application Framework, consisting of the Zowe desktop and App server.

* **API Gateway**  

  The API Gateway is a proxy server that routes requests from clients on its northbound edge, such as web browsers or the Zowe command line interface, to servers on its southbound edge that are able to provide data to serve the request. The API Gateway is also responsible for generating the authentication token used to provide single sign-on (SSO) functionality. See https://docs.zowe.org/stable/getting-started/zowe-architecture/#api-gateway

* **API Catalog** 

  The API Catalog provides a list of the API services that have registered themselves as catalog tiles. 

* **API Discovery** 

  a service to allow RESTful services to be dynamically added to the API Catalog

* **App Server** 

  The App Server is a node.js server which is the server side of the Zowe Application framework and hosts the web content of the framework too. This server provides the Zowe desktop, which is accessible through a web browser. The Zowe desktop includes a number of applications that run inside the Application Framework such as a 3270 emulator and a File Editor.     

* **Caching Service** 

  This feature is designed for Zowe components in a high availability configuration. It supports the High Availability of all components within Zowe, allowing components to be stateless by providing a mechanism to offload their state to a location accessible by all instances of the service, including those which just started 
       
* **z/OS Explorer Services**
  
* **Zowe Systems Services Server (ZSS)** 

  The Zowe desktop delegates a number of its services to the ZSS server which it accesses through the http port 8542. ZSS is written in C and has native calls to z/OS to provide its services. For more information, see Zowe architecture | Zowe Docs
      
* **ZIS (Zowe Interprocess Services)**

  An APF authorized server application that provides privileged services to Zowe in a secure manner. For security reasons, it is not an HTTP server. Instead, this server has a trust relationship with ZSS. Other Zowe components can work through ZSS in order to handle z/OS data that would otherwise be unavailable or insecure to access from higher-level languages and software. 

* **Zowe server infrastructure**  

  The set of programs (ex "zwe") and utilities (ex JCL, scripts) which manage the Zowe server configuration and components. The infrastructure standardizes the packaging of components and controls how they are started, stopped, and how configuration is provided to them. 

##  Installation & Configuration

* **Convenience build**


* **Instance.env** - V1 Only

  The Zowe instance directory contains a file instance.env that stores the Zowe configuration data. The data is read each time Zowe is started. You can modify instance.env to configure the Zowe runtime. See https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/configure-instance-directory/#updating-the-instanceenv-configuration-file 

* **Zowe runtime**
 
* **Started task** 

  a started task (STC) is a type of runnable/running program on z/os. Zowe started task (See also ZWESVSTC) – Does it need to go in Glossary? https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.1.0?topic=tasks-determining-whether-use-started-task
  Zowe has 3 actually:
  - ZWESVSTC: v1 primary server STC
  - ZWESLSTC: v1 HA/FT primary server STC, or the primary server STC for v2 (SVSTC goes away in v2)
  - ZWESISTC: ZIS STC

* **workspace directory**

  The standard directory where Zowe server component and extension configuration is stored. In v1, this was located within the instance directory, but in v2 it can be any directory specified by the zowe configuration file. Refered to in code as `WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY` (v1) and `zowe.workspaceDirectory` (v2).

* **Zowe configuration file**

  Zowe.yaml: It is a YAML file that is required to configure Zowe runtime. It can be used as an alternative to instance.env if you have to configure Zowe in more granular level. It is also required to start Zowe in high availability mode. See https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/configure-instance-directory/#creating-the-zoweyaml-file 

* **Zowe instance**
    
* **Zowe instance directory** 

  Also known as <INSTANCE_DIR>. It contains information that is specific to a launch of Zowe. It contains configuration settings that determine how an instance of the Zowe server is started, such as ports that are used or paths to dependent Java and Node.js runtimes.  The instance directory also contains log directory where different 'microservices' write trace data for diagnosis, as well as a workspace and shell scripts to start and stop Zowe.

* **Zowe sample library**

  (See also SZWESAMP) – Does it need to go in Glossary?

* **ZWESVUSR** 

  This is a started task ID used to run the PROCLIB ZWESVSTC. The task starts a USS environment using BPXBATSL that executes server components such as the Application Framework, API Mediation Layer, and Z Secure Services servers. To work with USS, the user ID ZWESVUSR must have a valid OMVS segment. For more information, see [System requirements](systemrequirements-zos#zwesvusr).

* **Zowe runtime directory**

  The USS directory where the Zowe server runtime is located. In v1, this is referred to as `<RUNTIME_DIR>` and is the location where `zowe-configure-instance` was used at install. In v2, this is referred to as `zowe.runtimeDirectory` and is the parent directory of the `zwe` command.

## Operation

### Zowe Application Framework

* **App2App**

  It is a unique feature to Zowe environment where one application plug-in can communicate with another and it is applicable to multiple application plug-ins. The application framework provides constructs that facilitate this ability. See [Application-to-application communication](../extend/extend-desktop/mvd-apptoappcommunication) for more information.

* **Config Service**

  The Config(uration) Service is a part of the Application Framework which allows plugins and the framework itself to store user configuration as JSON or binary formats. The configuration is stored in a hierarchy in which company-wide and system-wide defaults can exist for all users, and users may override the defaults if policy allows it. What can be stored and what can be overridden is according to plugin definition and administrative configuration.

* **MVS (multiple virtual storage) Explorer** 

  view z/OS data sets from the Zowe Desktop

* **USS Explorer** 

  a plug-in provided with zowe to view z/OS UNIX files from the Zowe Desktop

* **File Explorer**

  a plug-in provided with Zowe to allow users to view z/OS files and data sets using a RESTful interface. Also used by the MVS Explorer UI and USS Explorer UI

* **JES Explorer** 

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

### Zowe CLI


## Tools & Plug-ins

* **Configuration file**
 
* **API ML Plain Java Enabler (PJE)**

  is a library which helps to simplify the process of onboarding a REST service with the API ML

* **Service**

  A service provides one or more APIs, and is identified by a service ID. Note that sometimes the term "service name" is used to mean service ID.The default service ID is provided by the service developer in the service configuration file.A system administrator can replace the service ID with a deployment environment specific name using additional configuration that is external to the service deployment unit. Most often, this is configured in a JAR or WAR file.Services are deployed using one or more service instances, which share the same service ID and implementation.

* **Extension** 

* **Plug-in** 


## Community

* **Open Mainframe Project (OMP)**
  
  It is an organization which hosts and promotes development of open source software for the benefit of the IBM z mainframe community, including but not limited to z/OS. Zowe is one of several programs in this project. See [Open Mainframe Project website](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/) for more information.

* **Zowe Conformance Program** 
 
* **Squad** 
  
  A squad is a group of people contributing and participating in the Zowe project. Such a group owns one or more projects. Every squad is required to have a representative on the Technical Steering Committee (TSC), and participate in relevant working groups. See [Squads](https://github.com/zowe/community/blob/master/Technical-Steering-Committee/squads.md) for more information.
