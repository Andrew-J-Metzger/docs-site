# Usage tips

Make the best use of Zowe Explorer with the following tips.

## Data sets, USS, and jobs persistence settings

You can store any data sets, USS files, or jobs permanently in the **Favorites** tab. Right-click on a data set, USS file, or job and click **Add Favorite**.

## Identify syntax errors with a syntax highlighter

Zowe Explorer supports a syntax highlighter for data sets. To enhance the experience of using the extension, you can download an extension that highlights syntax.

## Configure the detected language of a file or data set

You can configure Visual Studio Code to use a specific language for a particular file extension type. This prevents the language for a file or data set opened in Zowe Explorer to be detected incorrectly. To set file associations, see [Add a file extension to a language](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/overview#_add-a-file-extension-to-a-language).

## Manage a profile

You can manage existing profiles listed in the **Side Bar** by right clicking on the profile and selecting the desired option from the **Quick Pick**. The feature lets you modify the information included in your profile.

## Delete a profile

Right-click the profile and select **Manage Profile** to see a list of options in the **Quick Pick**. Select **Delete Profile** to open the associated configuration file and manually delete the profile.

## Hide a profile

You can hide a profile from the **Side Bar** by right-clicking the profile, selecting the **Manage Profile** option, and then clicking **Hide Profile**. If necessary, add the profile back by clicking the **+** icon on the **DATA SETS**, **UNIX SYSTEM SERVICES (USS)**, or **JOBS** bar.

## Multi-select functionality

Apply an action to multiple objects at the same time for increased efficiency. You can do this with actions such as **Copy** (data sets, USS), **Delete**, **Add to Favorites**.

To do so, use the `Shift` key to select a continuous range of items, or select multiple items by pressing the `Ctrl` key as you select each item. Once the items are selected, right-click to choose the action from the menu.

## Open recent members

Zowe Explorer lets you open a list of members you have previously worked on. You can access the list by pressing `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`R` or `Command`+`Option`+`R`.
