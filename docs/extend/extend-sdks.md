# Developing for Zowe SDKs

The Zowe SDKs are open source. You can contribute to add features, enhancements, and bug fixes to the source code.

The functionality is currently limited to the interfaces provided by IBM z/OSMF. As a plug-in developer, you can enhance the SDK by creating a package that exposes programmatic APIs for your service.

For detailed contribution guidelines, see the following documents:

- [Zowe Node.js Client SDK guidelines](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/blob/master/docs/SDKGuidelines.md)
- [Zowe Python Client SDK guidelines](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-client-python-sdk/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
