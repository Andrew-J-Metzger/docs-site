# Quick Start for Development

To validate that the service properly works with the API Mediation Layer you need to have a running instance of API Mediation Layer first. There are few options that are available:

- Install Zowe and validate against Zowe instance of API Mediation Layer
  - For this setup you can either run Zowe without certificates or preferably with certificates generated by installation in the keystore
- Run API Mediation Layer in Codespace or on local machine directly
  - The details are available in [API Mediation Layer repository](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/)
- Run API Mediation Layer in containers 
  - The details are available in [Docker for API Mediation Layer](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/tree/v3.x.x/docker)
- Run API Mediation Layer as Java services on z/OS
  - This part isn't documented but is possible. You would need to build the services first, then upload them to the mainframe  

To learn more about the certificate setup options for API Mediation Layer with respect to the Development purposes consult [Certificate Management in Zowe API Mediation Layer](./certificate-management-in-zowe-apiml.md).
